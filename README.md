# Detecting Diachronic Meaning Shifts in Dutch
This is the source code for the work presented in the [CLIN](http://www.ccl.kuleuven.be/CLIN27) talk _''Can we spot meaning shifts in diachronic representations?''_ ([abstract](http://www.ccl.kuleuven.be/CLIN27/abstracts.html#Abstract01) | [slides](http://www.let.rug.nl/haagsma/papers/clin2017slides.pdf)). A paper based on the experiments presented in this talk, _''A Critical Assessment of a Method for Detecting Diachronic Meaning Shifts: Lessons Learnt from Experiments on Dutch''_ ([pdf](http://www.clinjournal.org/)), is published in the [CLIN Journal](http://www.clinjournal.org/) [pdf](http://www.clinjournal.org/sites/clinjournal.org/files/05.critical-assessment-method.pdf). 

You can use this code to create diachronic meaning representations based on any significantly large diachronic corpus of Dutch, and investigate and analyse those representations to detect known meaning shifts. 

## Requirements 
To run this code, you'll need:
* Python 2.7.6
* gensim 0.13.2
* scipy 0.18.1
* matplotlib 2.0.0

Different versions might work just as well, but cannot be guaranteed. Most scripts also expect there to be a folder called `working` in the main code directory.

In addition, we made use of:
* The [Elephant](https://github.com/ParallelMeaningBank/elephant) tokenizer
* The [LASSY](https://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/Lassy/) Small corpus

## Additional Files
* `most_frequent_*_5000.txt`: Lists of the 5000 most frequent words/nouns/verbs in LASSY
* `most_frequent_words_5000_average_similarity.json`: Average similarity in the Trouw and Volkskrant corpora for the 5000 most frequent words in LASSY
* `word_list_combined.txt`: Initial list of words to investigate (before frequency cut-off)
* `word_list_combined_results.json`: Counts, frequencies and self-similarities in both corpora for the words in the list above
* `plots/*.png`: Plots of the words discussed in the paper and the talk, as generated by the script `analyze_and_plot_words.py`.
